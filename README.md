## Rust Tokio Service with MongoDB Example
This example demonstrates a simple Rust service built using the Tokio asynchronous runtime. The service provides an API connected to a MongoDB database.

The project follows the principles of clean architecture and incorporates best practices in Rust development.

### Features and Roadmap
###### Current Features:
- [X] Asynchronous Design: Leveraging the Tokio asynchronous runtime for efficient and non-blocking I/O operations.
- [X] MongoDB Integration: Utilizing MongoDB as the backend database to store and retrieve data.
- [X] Clean Architecture: Following the principles of clean architecture to promote separation of concerns and maintainability.
###### Roadmap for Future Development:
- [ ] Graceful Shutdown: Implementing a graceful shutdown mechanism to ensure that the service shuts down cleanly without losing data or connections.
- [ ] Metrics via Prometheus: Integrating Prometheus for collecting and monitoring service metrics to gain insights into performance and resource utilization.
- [ ] Logging: Implementing comprehensive logging to capture and analyze service events, errors, and operational information.
- [ ] Traceability: Enhancing traceability by implementing distributed tracing to monitor and debug requests as they traverse through the system.
- [ ] Security Enhancements: Adding authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API endpoints and data access.
- [ ] Testing: Implementing unit tests, integration tests, and possibly property-based testing to ensure the reliability and correctness of the service.
- [ ] Documentation: Improving code documentation and providing comprehensive API documentation for better usability and maintainability.
- [ ] Error Handling: Enhancing error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors and failures, ensuring robustness and reliability.
- [ ] Performance Optimization: Identifying and optimizing performance bottlenecks to improve service scalability and responsiveness.

### Usage
To run the example service, follow these steps:

Install Rust and Cargo if you haven't already.
Setup the mongo locally:```docker run --name my-mongo-container -d -p 27017:27017 mongo```
Navigate to the project directory and run:```cargo run```.
Access the API endpoints at http://localhost:8080.
